# Monopoly
This is the board game Monopoly in Processing!. We implemented a lot of Monopoly's features, but ultimately, time ran out. Therefore, some features that are present in the game of Monopoly are not present here (like trading) and some features are not quite exactly the same as in the real board game.

# List of features
- Clicking in the middle of the board will roll the die and go to the next turn
- Clicking on a property tile will bring up a pop-up menu asking you what to do
  -For the purposes of demonstration, you do NOT need a monopoly to build a house, you just need to own the property
  -Therefore, you can build a house!
  -You can also sell the house for half the purchase price
- There is a scrolling history log in the bottom right hand corner of the window
- Landing on a Chance or Community Chest tile would result in pop-ups and the action would be automatically performed
- Landing on an unowned property gives you the option to buy or auction
  - Auctioning works like an actual auction: highest bidder wins
  - There are many rules to bidding that would lead to disqualification
- Automatic rent collection and performance of actions
- The window should be dynamic if you change size and keep ratio the same
- If you roll a double, you can roll again. If you roll three doubles in one turn you will be sent to jail automatically.
- When in jail you will start the turn with a prompt with multiple options :
  - Pay a fine of $50 : let's you get out of jail and have a normal turn.
  - Try to roll a double : if you roll a double you get to leave jail and advanced. Rolling a double in this case does not give you 
  another roll
  - Use a get out of jail card: Same as paying a fine with the exception that it is free.
